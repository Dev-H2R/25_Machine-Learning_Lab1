# Machine Learning Lab 3: Concept Learning Algorithms

## Objective

The objective of this practical is to implement two fundamental concept learning algorithms: the **Find-S Algorithm** and the **Candidate Elimination Algorithm**, to learn a target concept from a given dataset.

## Files

- `ML_Lab3.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the practical.
- `enjoy.csv`: The dataset used for training the algorithms. It contains features such as Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast to predict whether a sport is enjoyed (EnjoySport).

## Practical Steps Covered

### 1. Data Loading & Inspection

- Loading the dataset into a DataFrame using `pandas`.
- Inspecting the data structure using:
  - `.head()`
  - `.tail()`
  - `.shape`
  - `.info()`
  - `.describe()`

### 2. Find-S Algorithm Implementation

- Extracting features and the target variable from the dataset.
- Initializing the most specific hypothesis.
- Updating the hypothesis for each positive training example.
- Finding the maximally specific hypothesis.

### 3. Candidate Elimination Algorithm Implementation

- Initializing both specific and general boundaries.
- Iteratively updating the specific boundary for positive examples.
- Updating the general boundary for negative examples.
- Finding the version space with the final specific and general boundaries.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
